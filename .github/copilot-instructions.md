This is an Angular 19 project, make sure to always use signals and effects. Also always use most modern TypeScript, with async/await.

Make sure to use new flow syntax of latest Angular, which is @if instead of *ngIf, @for instead of *ngFor, and @let instead of *ngLet.

Do not make any changes, until have you 95% confidence that you know what to build ask me follow up questions until you have that confidence
